## Data Types in Java
Data types specify the different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable. There are two types of data types in Java:

- Primitive data types: The primitive data types include boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
- Non-primitive data types: The non-primitive data types include Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.

### Java Primitive Data Types
In Java language, primitive data types are the building blocks of data manipulation. These are the most basic data types available in Java language.

Java is a statically-typed programming language. It means, all variables must be declared before its use. That is why we need to declare variable's type and name.

There are 8 types of primitive data types:
- boolean data type
- byte data type
- char data type
- short data type
- int data type
- long data type
- float data type
- double data type

| Data Type   | Default Value | Default size and Range
| ----------- | ------------- |------------
| boolean     | false         | 1 bit
| char        | '\u0000'      | 2 byte '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)
| byte        | 0             | 1 byte -128 to 127 (inclusive)
| short       | 0             | 2 byte -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive)
| int         | 0             | 4 byte -2,147,483,648 (-2^31) to 2,147,483,647 (2^31 -1) (inclusive)
| long        | 0L            | 8 byte -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63) to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807(2^63 -1)(inclusive)
| float       | 0.0f          | 4 byte unlimited
| double      | 0.0d          | 8 byte unlimited
